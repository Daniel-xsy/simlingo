"""
Route reconstruction from CARLA waypoints.

This module rebuilds driving routes from a start waypoint by following road
successors, executing lane changes, and tracing junction branches.  It also
provides actionability sampling on rebuilt routes and XML helpers for
emitting waypoint and scenario elements.

Key types:
    * ``RebuiltRoute`` — an immutable snapshot of a rebuilt route with
      positions, cumulative distances, and the underlying CARLA waypoints.
    * ``ActionSuffixResult`` — the waypoint list produced by executing a
      single navigation action (turn / lane change / lane follow).
